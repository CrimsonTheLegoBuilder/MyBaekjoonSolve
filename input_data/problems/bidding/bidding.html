Bridge is a very complicated card game, and the bidding part is
particularly difficult to master.  The bidding is made even more
difficult because players use different bidding conventions
(meanings assigned to bids).  In this problem, you are asked to write
a program that suggests the first bid that should be made.  The
bidding conventions described below are simplified from those used
by a certain person who shall remain nameless.
</p>

<p>
A bridge hand consists of 13 cards.  Each card has a suit (spades,
hearts, diamonds, or clubs) and a rank (A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,
4, 3, 2).  Here, the letter T denotes the card whose rank is 10.
Before making a bid, an experienced bridge player studies the number
of high card points (hcp) in the hand, as well as the distribution
(the number of cards in each suit).  The hcp contributed by each card
is completely determined by its rank as follows:
</p>
<center>
<table border=1>
<tr><th align=center>Rank</th> <th>hcp</th></tr>
<tr><td align=center>A</td><td align=center>4</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>K</td><td align=center>3</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>Q</td><td align=center>2</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>J</td><td align=center>1</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>others</td><td align=center>0</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
For example, if the hand is:
</p>
<center>
<table border=0>
<tr><td align=right>Spades:</td><td>A, 2</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Hearts:</td><td>K, J, T, 9, 2</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Diamonds:</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Clubs:</td><td>K, Q, 7, 4, 3</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Then this hand has 13 hcp and a distribution of 5-5-2-1 (the
distribution is usually listed in non-increasing order).  A
balanced distribution is any one of 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, and 5-3-3-2.
</p>

<p>
In bridge, an opening bid is either "pass" or consists of a level
(1-7) and a trump suit.  The trump suits are no trump, spades, hearts,
diamonds, clubs ranked in decreasing order.  Once a hand has been evaluated,
the player applies the following list of (simplified) rules to
determine the appropriate opening bid.  In cases where multiple rules
apply, the first one that applies should be used.  An "x" in a
distribution can be substituted with any non-negative number.  Multiple
"x"s in a distribution are not necessarily the same.
</p>

<ol>
<li>With at least 10 hcp and a y-x-x-x distribution (y &gt;= 8), bid 
    the suit with y cards at the 4 level.  This is known as a preemptive 
    bid.</li> 
<li>With 10-13 hcp and a 7-x-x-x distribution, bid the suit with 7 cards 
    at the 3-level.  This is known as a preemptive bid.</li>
<li>With 8-9 hcp and a y-x-x-x distribution (y &gt;= 7), bid the suit with 
    y cards at the 2-level if the y-card suit is Spades or Hearts.  This is
    known as a "weak-two" bid.</li>
<li>With 8-11 hcp and a 6-x-x-x distribution, in which Spades or
    Hearts is one of the 6-card suits, bid the higher rank suit at the
    2 level.  This is known as a "weak-two" bid.</li>
<li>With 11-15 hcp, a distribution of 4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4-0, and at least
    4 spades, bid Diamonds at the 2 level.  This is called the "Mini Roman
    Convention".</li>
<li>With 15-17 hcp and a balanced distribution, bid No Trump at the 1
    level provided that at least 3 suits are "stopped."  A suit is
    considered stopped if the suit contains at least one of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>an A;</li>
    <li>a K and one other;</li>
    <li>a Q and two others; or</li>
    <li>a J and three others;</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>With 20-22 hcp and a balanced distribution, bid No Trump at the 2
    level.</li>
<li>With at least 22 hcp, bid Clubs at the 2 level.</li>
<li>With 13-16 hcp:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>If there is a 5-card or longer suit in Spades or Hearts, 
        bid it at the 1 level.  If both bids are possible, bid the longer
        suit.  If both suits have the same length, bid the higher ranking
        suit.</li>
    <li>Without a 5-card suit in Spades or Hearts, bid the longer of
        Diamonds or Clubs at the 1 level (whichever one has the most 
        number of cards) .  If there is a tie, bid the higher
        ranking suit.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
<li>With at least 17 hcp, bid the longest suit at the 1 level.  If
    there is a tie, bid the lowest ranking suit.  This is known as
    a "reverse".</li>
<li>If none of the rules above is applicable, bid Pass.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the example above, rule 9a applies and a bid of 1 Hearts 
should be made.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The input consists of a number of cases.  The bridge hand for each
case is specified on one line, with a single space separating each of
the 13 cards in the hand.  Each card is given as a two-character
string.  The first letter is the suit (S, H, D, C) and the second
character is the rank (A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2).
The end of input is terminated by end-of-file.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
For each case, print the hand number (starting from 1), followed by a
colon and a space, and then the suggested bid on a single line (see
below for the exact format).  Each bid is either "Pass" or a level and
a suit ("No Trump", "Spades", "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs") separated
by a single space.
