<h1>Problem F: Marbles in Three Baskets</h1>

<p>
<b>Input:</b> <tt>marbles.in</tt><br>
<b>Output:</b> <tt>marbles.out</tt>
</p>


<p>
Each of three baskets contains a certain number of marbles. You may
move from one basket into another basket as many marbles as are
already there, thus doubling the quantity in the basket that received
the marbles. You must find a sequence of moves that will yield the
same number of marbles in the three baskets. Moreover, you must
achieve the goal in the smallest possible number of moves. Your
program must also recognize the case in which there is no such
sequence of moves.
</p>


<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
Each line of the input file will contain data for one instance of the
problem: three positive integers, with one blank space separating adjacent
integers. The three integers represent the initial numbers of marbles
in the three baskets. The sum of the three integers will be at most
60.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
The output will begin with the initial configuration from the
input. Thereafter, on successive lines, the number of marbles in the
respective baskets will be printed after each move, concluding with
the line in which the three numbers are identical. As stated above,
the goal must be achieved in the smallest possible number of
moves. (The correct output is not unique, however.  There
may be different sequences of moves which achieve the goal correctly
in the smallest possible number of steps.)  
If there is no sequence of
moves to achieve the goal, only the initial configuration will be
printed. Each integer in the output will be right-justified in a field
of width 4.  Each instance of the problem will be concluded by a line
of 12 equal signs.
