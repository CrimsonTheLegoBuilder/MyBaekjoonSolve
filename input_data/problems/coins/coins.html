<title>Problem B: Baskets of Gold Coins</title>
<h1>Problem B: Baskets of Gold Coins</h1>

<p>
<b>Input:</b> <tt>coins.in</tt><br>
<b>Output:</b> <tt>coins.out</tt>
</p>


<p>
You are given <VAR>N</VAR> baskets of gold coins. The baskets are
numbered from 1 to <var>N</var>. In all except one of the baskets,
each gold coin weighs <var>w</var> grams. In the one exceptional
basket, each gold coin weighs <var>w-d</var> grams. A wizard appears
on the scene and takes 1 coin from Basket 1, 2 coins from Basket 2,
and so on, up to and including <var>N-1</var> coins from Basket
<var>N-1</var>. He does not take any coins from Basket
<var>N</var>. He weighs the selected coins and concludes which of the
<var>N</var> baskets contains the lighter coins. Your mission is to
emulate the wizard's computation.
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The input file will consist of one or more lines; each line will
contain data for one instance of the problem. More specifically, each
line will contain four positive integers, separated by one blank
space. The first three integers are, respectively, the numbers <var>N, w</var>,
and <var>d</var>, as described above. The fourth integer is the result of
weighing the selected coins.
</p>

<p>
<var>N</var> will be at least 2 and not more than 8000. The value of
<var>w</var> will be at most 30. The value of <var>d</var> will be
less than <var>w</var>.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
For each instance of the problem, your program will produce one line
of output, consisting of one positive integer: the number of the
basket that contains lighter coins than the other baskets.
