<h1>Problem H: Knots</h1>

<p>
<b>Input:</b>: <tt>knots.in</tt><br>
<b>Output:</b>: <tt>knots.out</tt>
</p>

<p>An even number <var>N</var> of strands are stuck through a wall. On
one side of the wall, a girl ties <var>N/2</var> knots between
disjoint pairs of strands. On the other side of the wall, the girl's
groom-to-be also ties <var>N/2</var> knots between disjoint pairs of strands.
You are to find the probability that the knotted strands form one big
loop (in which case the couple will be allowed to marry). </p>

<p>For example, suppose that <var>N</var> = 4 and you number the
strands 1, 2, 3, 4. Also suppose that the girl has created the
following pairs of strands by tying knots: {(1, 4), (2,3)}. Then the
groom-to-be has two choices for tying the knots on his side: {(1,2),
{3,4)} or {(1,3), (2,4)}.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The input file consists of one or more lines. Each line of the input file
contains a positive even integer, less than or equal to 100. This integer
represents the number of strands in the wall.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>For each line of input, the program will produce exactly one
line of output: the probability that the knotted strands form one big loop,
given the number of strands on the corresponding line of input.  Print
the probability to 5 decimal places.</p>
