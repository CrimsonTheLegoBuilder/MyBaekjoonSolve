<p>
Professor Permula gave a number of permutations of the <em>n</em>
integers 1, 2, ..., <em>n</em> to her students.  For each integer
<em>i</em> (1 &lt;= <em>i</em> &lt;= <em>n</em>), she asks the
students to write down the number of integers greater than <em>i</em>
that appears before <em>i</em> in the given permutation.  This number
is denoted <em>a<sub>i</sub></em>.  For example, if <var>n</var> = 8
and the permutation is 2,7,3,5,4,1,8,6, then <var>a<sub>1</sub></var>
= 5 because there are 5 numbers (2, 7, 3, 5, 4) greater than 1
appearing before it.  Similarly, <var>a<sub>4</sub></var> = 2 because
there are 2 numbers (7, 5) greater than 4 appearing before it.

John, one of the students in the class, is studying for the final exams
now.  He found out that he has lost the assignment questions.  He only
has the answers (the <em>a<sub>i</sub></em>'s) but not the original
permutation.  Can you help him determine the original permutation, so
he can review how to obtain the answers?
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The input consists of a number of test cases.  Each test case starts
with a line containing the integer <em>n</em> (<em>n</em> &lt;= 500).
The next <em>n</em> lines give the values of <em>a<sub>1</sub></em>,
..., <em>a<sub>n</sub></em>.  The input ends with <em>n</em> = 0.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
For each test case, print a line specifying the original permutation.
Adjacent elements of a permutation should be separated by a comma.
Note that some cases may require you to print lines containing more than
80 characters.
